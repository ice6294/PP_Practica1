Pediatric stroke (PS) is a relatively rare disease, having an estimated incidence of 2.5–13/100,000/year [1–4], but remains one of the most common causes of death in childhood, with a mortality rate of 0.6/100,000 dead/year [5, 6]. PS has also seriously high morbidity and long-term outcome and is nowadays gaining more interest because of its heavy consequences and costs, both personal and social. Indeed, about half of the surviving patients develop some neurologic or cognitive impairment, and just more than a quarter, epilepsy.As in adults, PS can be ischemic or hemorrhagic; although ischemic stroke is more common, prevalence is variable [7, 8]. Ischemic stroke includes Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis (CSVT); Hemorrhagic Stroke (HS) includes intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage [9].AIS, both in neonatal and childhood forms, has a higher incidence among males [5, 10–14] and black people [5, 7]. AIS is relapsing in 6%–37% of little patients [15–19] and the risk appears highest in the first 6 months after the first episode [19, 20]. Risk factors for relapse include vascular abnormalities as first stroke cause [19, 20], and the presence of thrombotic risk factors [20], either isolated or as part of multiple risk factors [20, 21]. CSVT has an incidence of 2.6/100,000 children/year in the neonatal period and of 0.4 and 0.7/100,000 children/year in childhood [22].The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) is estimated between 0.7 to 5.1/100,000 children/year [23, 24] and, similar to childhood AIS, is more common in males and blacks [11, 25]. The mean age at diagnosis is 6–10 years [1].A prompt and precise diagnosis of PS, associated to an effective management of vascular emergencies, is a crucial point to reach a correct therapy and, consequently, a positive outcome.This paper will focus on main clinical features and radiological diagnosis of pediatric stroke.
